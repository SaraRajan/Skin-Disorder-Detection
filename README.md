 The medical sector considers the detection and observation of skin diseases to be a major concern. The number of individuals encountering skin-related problems 
 is growing more quickly due to increasing pollution and consumption of subpar food. The major concern isn't health, but having bad skin makes us less confident. 
 Regularly inspecting your skin is an important step in identifying any degenerative or early changes in your skin that could lead to skin disease. Machine learning 
 techniques can aid in the development of strong frameworks that can classify many types of skin diseases.
